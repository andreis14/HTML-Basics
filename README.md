Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities,
 but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.




You might also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them equal opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances. 
Just as it is wrong to exclude someone from a physical building because they are in a wheelchair (modern public buildings generally have wheelchair ramps or elevators), 
it is also not right to exclude someone from a website because they have a visual impairment. We are all different, but we are all human,
and therefore have the same human rights.



Accessibility is the right thing to do. Providing accessible sites is part of the law in some countries, 
which can open up some significant markets that otherwise would not be able to use your services or buy your products.




Building accessible sites benefit everyone:

-Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
-Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
-Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
-Did we mention it is also the law in some places?
